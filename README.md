Multi-threaded implementation of PCRE2 to look for a specific function with a hybrid/regex approach. 
Likely just grok/ai slop, but it's similar to a previous project so it shows some potential. 

Either way Grok-3 showed me a faster library for regex matching and seemingly a relatively simple way to get multi-threaded performance.
It did take a bit of effort to push through a few hallucinations and its own self inflicted bugs at least, but as a first experience with an AI in this scenario, I'm impressed.
